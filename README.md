# ProductParsing
Working at my first technical part time job, I spent a lot of time redirecting links that were broken or the product was out of stock. It took a long time and was tedious
to copy and paste the same thing over again.

This Python program takes a CSV where each row has a target URL and a directed URL. It creates a new csv file with just the ending tags of the URL. This allowed me to automate the Redirection process 
by allowing me to quickly give data to our e-commerce store without having to make sure I copy the right part multiple times to do one redirect.
